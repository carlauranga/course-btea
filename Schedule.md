#Schedule

##Day 1
- Set-up computing environments for bioinformatics analysis and learn basic unix commands.    
- Use version control for effective documentation of analyses, backup, and collaboration

1) AM Lecture:  Roberts **Open Science and Helping Future You**
2) Getting comfortable with text and command-line (shell.md)
3) Markdown - Notepad++
4) Version control - Github
5) Jupyter Notebooks
6) SageMathCloud
7) **Activity** ??  Describe a transcriptome  (Show how generated)
Assemble transcriptomes - maybe iPlant, Galaxy.


Idea - publish notebooks and post on wiki by end of day!!



##Day 2
- Characterize and annotate novel transcriptomes 
AM Lecture:  Vadopalas **Bivalve Reproduction: a tale of two species**

1) Blast
2) Compare to full genome (maybe start day before) 
3) Graphics
Activity


##Day 3
- Identify differentially expressed genes and alternative splice products  

AM Lecture:  Vadopalas **Ecological and hatchery perspective on reproduction**

1) DESeq - - RNASeq Heat Shock!- gonads 
2) Enrichment analysis
3) Proteomics??? (might not have time)

4 ) mini project - Relationship of dm-TE and DE (todoist)

Activity 


##Day 4
- Assess epigenetic variation in relation to genomic feature
- 
AM Lecture:  Roberts **Epigenetics: this changes everything**

1) In silico anlaysis
Do corals
then new transcriptomes

Bisulfite data -
