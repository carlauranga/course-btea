#Schedule

This is a multi-day course with hands-on bioinformatics analyses accompanied with discussions of fundamental physiological processes, specific case studies, and underlying laboratory techniques. The general objective of this course is to provide participants with core computing skills and experience with genomic datasets.   

One primary case study will be the examination of novel transcriptome datasets from reproductive tissue from two bivalves. The underlying goal of the week long course is to complete a peer-review ready manuscript. 

##Day 1
- Set-up computing environments for bioinformatics analysis and learn basic unix commands.    
- Use version control for effective documentation of analyses, backup, and collaboration

1) **AM Lecture**:  Roberts _Open Science and Helping Future You_     
2) Getting comfortable with text and command-line (shell.md)  ~maybe SMC  or git bash~    
3) Markdown - Notepad++      
4) Version control - Github        
5) Jupyter (formerly IPython) Notebooks        
6) SageMathCloud            
7) **Activity** -  _Describe transcriptome_  (Show how generated)         
	- Assemble transcriptomes - maybe iPlant, Galaxy.          
	- _Product_ - publish notebooks and post on wiki by end of day!!        
	- ITP-  Start blast

---

##Day 2
- Characterize and annotate novel transcriptomes 
AM Lecture:  Vadopalas **Bivalve Reproduction: a tale of two species**

1) Blast
2) Compare to full genome (maybe start day before) 
3) Graphics
Activity


##Day 3
- Identify differentially expressed genes and alternative splice products  

AM Lecture:  Vadopalas **Ecological and hatchery perspective on reproduction**

1) DESeq - - RNASeq Heat Shock!- gonads 
2) Enrichment analysis
3) Proteomics??? (might not have time)

4 ) mini project - Relationship of dm-TE and DE (todoist)

Activity 


##Day 4
- Assess epigenetic variation in relation to genomic feature
- 
AM Lecture:  Roberts **Epigenetics: this changes everything**

1) In silico anlaysis
Do corals
then new transcriptomes

Bisulfite data -
